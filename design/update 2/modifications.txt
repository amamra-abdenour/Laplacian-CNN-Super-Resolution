Modifications:

Most of the details of this project are outlined in the overview file. The signficant changes made are:

1. Switch from a Generative Adversarial Network to a Laplacian Convolutional network

2. No interface between multiple computers. This is very easy to implement, but unfortunately there is no time to integrate it with the existing application.

3. A much heavier emphasis was placed on the gui.
